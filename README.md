# UMH-Python-Game
Greatest RPG adventure ever made (not)
This game is my first attempt at understanding python and how everything works, so most parts are probably poorly optimized.
Just unzip the Assets rar file, put all the code in the same place, and enjoy the game.
This is a python game made entirely using python libraries and some photoshop-edited images.
This game is entirely owned by Vladisimo and limiteddata. (that's why it's so bad).
Any attempt to copy or improve this game is absolutely welcome, just don't copy and paste, that sucks.
